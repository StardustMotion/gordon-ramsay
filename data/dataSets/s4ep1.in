A dead lobster, stuck at the bottom.
Stop, stop!
If your grandfather sat at my table today, he'd be beating the crap outta you.
Hello.
Somebody die? Did somebody pass away?
No? You all look immaculately formal with the tuxedos.
Undertakers at a funeral.
How old are those suits? They are beautiful! Huh? Made to measure.
Wow, wow, wow.
Hi, how are you?
No, you're okay. 
Okay, great.
Sorry, first name, excuse me?
Where's that from?
Oh, wow.
I'd love to.
I'm very happy to see another unique tuxedo.
You wear this every day for lunch?
Anyway So when did the Spanish Pavillion open? 
Wow.
You're here five days?
Politician?
And he's the Chef de cuisine?
Thank you.
I'll have a little eat.
Thank you.
Oh, yes.
Let's start off with lobster bisque.
Um, I'll go for the, uh, marinara.
Wonderful.
Please.
Lovely.
In the beginning, when I walked in, I thought it was a funeral.
You've got me back.
Okay, brilliant.
Yeah, I can't wait.
It just looks disgusting.
It's very creamy.
Is it always this creamy? 
It just looks like the lobster was dead before they cooked it.
Okay.
Is he dead?
He must be dead.
You keep a good eye on them? Surely not.
He's fucking dead.
A dead lobster! No, he's gone.
Ugh.
What I'm concerned about is, everything else in there, they've been feeding off that lobster.
And they've become full of bacteria.
Okay, good.
Hey, Michael.
Are you good?
I was just slightly concerned to see the dead lobsters in there 
You must be busy.
Thank you.
Okay.
Uh, what is all that there, the grease?
Can I have a little bowl to just drain some of that out? 
It's like they're swimming.
Thank you.
Ooh, dear.
It's like the Exxon valdez there.
You think there's too much olive oil in there? 
It's like a heart attack waiting to happen.
I hope there's a hospital nearby.
The chicken tastes absolutely dreadful.
I just want you to taste the chicken.
Just taste that.
You sound like a politician now.
Okay, I'm not fucking around.
That's gross.
Do me a favor.
Can you ask your brother to taste that?
What did Michael say?
Okay, fine.
Well if he thought that was fucking good, then I'm screwed.
And this is the?
The lobster in this paella Did it come from the tank?
Oh, fuck.
Okay.
Well, would you be so kind to taste it for me?
Badly, badly seasoned.
Out of respect for your granddad, that is a joke.
Give me five minutes and we'll have a chat together.
Yeah, please.
Thank you.
Very kind, but I've lost my appetite.
Okay.
I'm gonna get straight to the point.
Fucking bisque, dead lobsters, and the paella was burnt at the bottom.
This is your grandfather that put this thing together.
Was he sending food out like that?
The chicken was way overcooked.
Did you cook that dish?
What do you actually do, Michael?
You're the last line of defense.
Out of every dish that I had today, what did you taste of mine?
When it came back? 
If your grandfather sat at my table today, he'd be beating the crap out of you.
You're fucking dreaming, Michael.
Rancid chicken.
You can't serve that shit tonight!
I'll pick my own lobster right from the lobster tank for you.
Where's uh, where's Michael?
At the bar?
Undercooked?
They're right.
Raw.
Is this normal?
Michael, can anyone work together here? 
I mean, this is absolutely fucking hideous.
My God.
We need to get organized, big time.
Everyone's arguing with each other, and it's like, no teamwork anywhere.
Michael, keep it together.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Michael, Michael! Okay, okay, okay.
Michael, come here.
Just stop.
Stop.
Michael you're a fucking owner.
Just boom.
Big, deep breath.
Is that normal?
Yeah?
Okay.
Uh, what a day.
I've never, ever seen such a disorganized, fragmented service, ever.
Disaster! 
Confusion in the kitchen, chaos in the dining room.
Michael, I thought you were supposed to be running the kitchen.
I don't think you realize how bad tonight was.
I'll see you in the morning.
What is in there? 
They're not drumsticks, they're crab sticks.
Just dumped in here, on top of another bag of Alaskan crab.
No dates, no labels.
How on earth are you supposed to run a business when you've got no idea what's in the freezers? 
What is down in here? 
My God, it gets worse.
Look at it.
It's absolutely jam-packed.
Chicken after chicken after chicken.
My big worry is how much chicken does this restaurant really need? 
I mean, there are just bags of it.
And not only that, the smell is horrific.
Ugh! 
My God.
Look at these fillets.
I've seen less packs at an army base.
There's over fifty packs of meat and whoever's buying this needs to be fired.
Now what worries me about this is there's one more fridge upstairs.
What is that? Pigeon.
Oh, my God.
It's never-ending.
Just when I think i've seen enough, there's more.
They're dead! 
Decomposed, drop dead! Oh, that's the snails.
Ugh, hell.
What is that in there? 
That is a raw, dead lobster.
That is disgusting.
Morning.
I just need you for two minutes.
Who in the hell buys the produce here? 
Who's responsible for that?
You are? Fucking pigeon.
What I'm trying to look at are the purchasing, the thousands of dollars of waste.
These here.
That's dead.
Let's have a little look around here.
Jerry, please.
And you wonder why I don't like your sauce.
That is a dead lobster.
And the freshest thing in this kitchen is that pigeon, flying around.
And he's lucky he's still alive.
I'd love to turn around and say, "that's it".
Have you seen what's downstairs in the fridge? 
Where do I start with this? 
Look at all this fucking meat here.
Ready for what?
Whatever came your way?
You're burning money you haven't got.
Spend some time together.
I've got to wash my fucking hands before I get diagnosed with fucking staphlococci.
Balbina, this is so sad, you know that.
What would your father say if he walked in here and saw that? 
It shows.
Jerry needs Michael, Michael needs Jerry.
They now have to roll up their sleeves, work together, but more importantly, they've got to set their differences aside as brothers and stop being so stubborn, 'cause that's what they are.
And the business is fragmented.
Michael, support!
You can't serve that shit tonight.
I want you to think of something that you want to cook.
In the kitchen, cooking.
Something that you'll want tonight as the special.First of all, I want to do a chicken and garlic.
A modern version.
I want you to work with me at the same time. I start it off with olive oil.
If you start off with butter, it's going to burn.
You've got that nice saut√© sear on the chicken.
From there, you put it over the top.
And then just scoop up a touch of that sauce.
Modern Spanish cuisine.
What do you think that you want to cook? 
Nice.
Go for it.
So far, it looks good.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's nice.
The chicken dish is a modern version of a garlic chicken.
Read the special back to me.
I'm making you nervous?
Just put your head in there for two minutes.
Cool it down.
Put it in there.
Stay in two minutes.
Okay, guys, let's go, yeah? 
Michael.
I want to look at you, yeah? And I want this level of communication.
Much better than we had last night.
First order comes in, it's a special.
Uh, Joe, Joe, is it me or are things taking a long time to come out?
Too slow.
Way too slow.
Come on, guys.
They didn't like it? 
Jerry, it's not normal.
It's not fucking normal.
Oh, come on.
Oh, no.
Jerry.
Urgently, quickly.
Smell.
No, but smell it.
Don't just say shit.
You can't serve that shit tonight.
Oh, stop! Stop! 
Oh, no! 
Have you got chicken in the fryer?
Just toss that chicken, eh?
No, don't serve it! Don't fucking dare!
Michael, how many fresh chickens are downstairs?
A case and a half downstairs in the fucking fridge? 
And he's serving you that stinky shit? 
You're cooking it, and it's off!
We've got fresh chickens downstairs.
Thank you, thank you.
If you're gonna keep the customers waiting, you've got to make sure it's right.
That's it.
Honestly, tonight was better.
Everybody liked the specials, but let's not get too excited about tonight, because the quality control has to be much better.
And Michael, your cooks are passing you stinking, rancid chicken, but you didn't spot it.
Jerry, I thought your performance tonight was bloody good.
Good night.
Good morning.
Good to see you all.
Let's be honest, not much has changed over the last 30 years, right?
Today is the beginning of a new era, and through that door is your future.
Are you ready to see it?
One, two, three.
Come on in.
Look at this.
A warm, inviting atmosphere.
We removed the stained glass to give it a modern feel.
And then down here, we've increased the seating so we have a lovely banquette.
Tablecloths have gone.
All the tables have been replaced.
This is walnut.
It's modern and it's warm.
On the tabletops, we have the most amazing China.
Provided by tabletops unlimited.
How exciting is that?
When your grandfather opened his restaurant there, he did not face the competition that you now face.
I really do mean competition.
Look at that.
Having studied the neighborhood, all these restaurants are serving the same bloody food.
You have an opportunity now to stand out.
Are you ready to see your dishes?
Come with me.
Let's go.
Please, come through.
Small tapas is the taste of Spain.
Authentic, delicious, and homemade.
You have to push the tapas.
This is what turns this restaurant around.
A roasted lamb Spanish meatball in a fresh tomato sauce.
Bacon-wrapped dates, yes? 
Sauteed prawns with garlic, a little bit of shaved fennel.
Olives with manchego cheese, yeah? 
We're going for flavor, simplicity, and we're going for Spain.
Come in, come in, come in, come in.
Look at these guys.
Come in.
Ah, look at you.
They now no longer look like undertakers.
Okay, tonight is your night.
There's nothing that you cannot do here.
Good luck.
Who do you think? 
That's right.
Absolutely, over.
He will not lose it.
Why are you talking so negatively?
Well, don't foresee.
Just focus.
You're thinking too hard.
It must hurt.
How is it?
Sure, and it's a great way of pulling in extra revenue.
Michael, let Jerry do his job.
Yeah? He's like a fucking rabbit in a headlight.
Now you, you, hey, step up to the mark a little bit, okay? Work with your team.
Michael, support!
Michael, come here.
Two seconds.
You have to keep it together.
He's your brother.
You can't do that in front of the fucking team.
You've got to show him some fucking respect.
Yes, it's hard, but you've got to back off.
He's up to his eyeballs in the fucking weeds, and you're laying into him.
Fucking slow down.
He's your brother, and it's your business and his business, got it? 
Right, regroup and organize after that.
Tonight confirmed that the Spanish Pavillion is back on the map and ready to compete.
But tomorrow, it starts all over again.
Tonight wasn't perfect, but we did make an amazing transformation.
Likewise.
Likewise, likewise.
You two, in 30 seconds, in the bar, please, together.
You have an amazing opportunity now to really turn this restaurant around, but it requires both of you.
Jerry, I thought you were just some politician.
You are a genuine leader.
Great potential.
Michael, a big heart, but you've got to focus behind that line.
If you stay focused and master those dishes, you'll get there.
And look after each other.
Good night.
When I first arrived here, I was greeted by a dead lobster and a restaurant stuck in the '70s.
And in just a matter of days, the Spanish Pavillion has been transformed.
But this restaurant will only succeed if those two brothers find a way to stay united and work together.
Big brother, little brother.
Being a chef is the best job in the world.
Being a chef never seems like a job, it becomes a true passion.
Being assertive and somewhat really firm has to be backed up with being fair.
Best to start at the bottom and gradually climb up. It's much more fun, too.
Chefs are nutters. They're all self-obsessed, delicate, dainty, insecure little souls and absolute psychopaths. Every last one of them.
Cooking a dish is fine, cooking it under pressure is a completely different ballgame.
Cooking is about passion, so it may look slightly temperamental in a way that it's too assertive to the naked eye.
Cooking today is a young man's game, I don't give a bollocks what anyone says.
Eating out doesn't have to be a formula. Eating out is about having fun. I get really frustrated when it's badly done.
Focus on your customers and make that restaurant synonymous to where you are in terms of area.
How many chefs do we know that prefer cooking for chefs than they do customers, yet customers are returning repeatedly and it's the level of support that determines the level of success that restaurant will have.
However amazing a dish looks, it is always the taste that lingers in your memory. Family and friends will appreciate a meal that tastes superb-even if you've brought the pan to the table.
I am well aware that a chef is only as good as his last meal.
I cook, I create, I'm incredibly excited by what I do, I've still got a lot to achieve.
I don't like looking back. I'm always constantly looking forward. I'm not the one to sort of sit and cry over spilt milk. I'm too busy looking for the next cow.
I suppose your security is your success and your key to success is your fine palate.
I think pressure's healthy, and very few can handle it.
I train my chefs completely different to anyone else. My young girls and guys, when they come to the kitchen, the first thing they get is a blindfold. 
I train my chefs with a blindfold. I'll get my sous-chef and myself to cook a dish. The young chef would have to sit down and eat it with a blindfold. If they can't identify the flavor, they shouldn't be cooking the dish.
If you want to become a great chef, you have to work with great chefs. And that's exactly what I did.
I'm Gordon Ramsay, for goodness sake: people know I'm volatile.
I'm not critic-proof, and I still take it personally, but I take it less personally now.
In any situation, location is crucial.
Initially let your food do the talking. You'll be surprised how far you go in a short period of time.
It's quite weird knocking that out of them and telling them to forget cooking for chefs. Forget what chefs say about your food.
I've had a lot of success. I've had failures, so I learn from the failure.
Kitchens are hard environments and they form incredibly strong characters.
My father was a swim teacher. We used to swim before school, swim after school.
Push your limit to the absolute extreme.
Put your head down and work hard. Never wait for things to happen, make them happen for yourself through hard graft and not giving up.
Stop taking things personally. Throughout the time with "Kitchen Nightmares" and "Hotel Hell", when they work, you don't get any praise.
Stopping the junk food and eating well is partially about cooking well and having the skills to do that.
Swearing is industry language. For as long as we're alive it's not going to change. You've got to be boisterous to get results.
The minute you start compromising for the sake of massaging somebody's ego, that's it, game over.
The secret is to make sure the business is running to perfection, with or without me.
There's a bond among a kitchen staff, I think. You spend more time with your chef in the kitchen than you do with your own family.
There's no bigger pain anywhere in the world than a vegetarian.
Two key ingredients in any successful chef: a quick learner and someone with a sharp brain.
What's frustrating more than anything is when chefs start to cut corners and believe that they are incognito in the way they send out appetizers, entrees, and they know it's not 100 percent, but they think the customers can't spot it.
When you cook under pressure you trade perfection.
When you find a guy who is powerful, a big father figure, you latch onto him immediately.
Would I swap what I have achieved as a cook if I could have been as successful as a footballer? Definitely.
You don't come into cooking to get rich.
You know, running a restaurant is something you have to be working at each and every day; it's not a foregone conclusion that you're a success.
