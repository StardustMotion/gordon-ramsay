Being a chef is the best job in the world.
Being a chef never seems like a job, it becomes a true passion.
Being assertive and somewhat really firm has to be backed up with being fair.
Best to start at the bottom and gradually climb up. It's much more fun, too.
Chefs are nutters. They're all self-obsessed, delicate, dainty, insecure little souls and absolute psychopaths. Every last one of them.
Cooking a dish is fine, cooking it under pressure is a completely different ballgame.
Cooking is about passion, so it may look slightly temperamental in a way that it's too assertive to the naked eye.
Cooking today is a young man's game, I don't give a bollocks what anyone says.
Eating out doesn't have to be a formula. Eating out is about having fun. I get really frustrated when it's badly done.
Focus on your customers and make that restaurant synonymous to where you are in terms of area.
How many chefs do we know that prefer cooking for chefs than they do customers, yet customers are returning repeatedly and it's the level of support that determines the level of success that restaurant will have.
However amazing a dish looks, it is always the taste that lingers in your memory. Family and friends will appreciate a meal that tastes superb-even if you've brought the pan to the table.
I am well aware that a chef is only as good as his last meal.
I cook, I create, I'm incredibly excited by what I do, I've still got a lot to achieve.
I don't like looking back. I'm always constantly looking forward. I'm not the one to sort of sit and cry over spilt milk. I'm too busy looking for the next cow.
I suppose your security is your success and your key to success is your fine palate.
I think pressure's healthy, and very few can handle it.
I train my chefs completely different to anyone else. My young girls and guys, when they come to the kitchen, the first thing they get is a blindfold. 
I train my chefs with a blindfold. I'll get my sous-chef and myself to cook a dish. The young chef would have to sit down and eat it with a blindfold. If they can't identify the flavor, they shouldn't be cooking the dish.
If you want to become a great chef, you have to work with great chefs. And that's exactly what I did.
I'm Gordon Ramsay, for goodness sake: people know I'm volatile.
I'm not critic-proof, and I still take it personally, but I take it less personally now.
In any situation, location is crucial.
Initially let your food do the talking. You'll be surprised how far you go in a short period of time.
It's quite weird knocking that out of them and telling them to forget cooking for chefs. Forget what chefs say about your food.
I've had a lot of success. I've had failures, so I learn from the failure.
Kitchens are hard environments and they form incredibly strong characters.
My father was a swim teacher. We used to swim before school, swim after school.
Push your limit to the absolute extreme.
Put your head down and work hard. Never wait for things to happen, make them happen for yourself through hard graft and not giving up.
Stop taking things personally. Throughout the time with "Kitchen Nightmares" and "Hotel Hell", when they work, you don't get any praise.
Stopping the junk food and eating well is partially about cooking well and having the skills to do that.
Swearing is industry language. For as long as we're alive it's not going to change. You've got to be boisterous to get results.
The minute you start compromising for the sake of massaging somebody's ego, that's it, game over.
The secret is to make sure the business is running to perfection, with or without me.
There's a bond among a kitchen staff, I think. You spend more time with your chef in the kitchen than you do with your own family.
There's no bigger pain anywhere in the world than a vegetarian.
Two key ingredients in any successful chef: a quick learner and someone with a sharp brain.
What's frustrating more than anything is when chefs start to cut corners and believe that they are incognito in the way they send out appetizers, entrees, and they know it's not 100 percent, but they think the customers can't spot it.
When you cook under pressure you trade perfection.
When you find a guy who is powerful, a big father figure, you latch onto him immediately.
Would I swap what I have achieved as a cook if I could have been as successful as a footballer? Definitely.
You don't come into cooking to get rich.
You know, running a restaurant is something you have to be working at each and every day; it's not a foregone conclusion that you're a success.
